Hobeian adds support for Hobeian Zigbee devices in Homey. This app enables seamless integration of Hobeian sensors into your smart home ecosystem.

The app currently supports the ZG-303Z Soil Moisture Sensor, a battery-powered Zigbee device that monitors soil moisture, temperature, and air humidity. With customizable calibration settings and configurable sampling intervals, you can fine-tune the sensor to match your specific gardening needs and receive alerts when your plants need attention.
